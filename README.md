# TeraHelix FpML Application

![Apps FpML Build](https://github.com/TeraHelix/apps-FpML/workflows/Apps%20FpML%20Build/badge.svg)

This project is a [Spear](https://www.terahelix.io/products-spear/index.html) integration of standard Financial products Markup Language (https://www.fpml.org/).

[Spear](https://www.terahelix.io/products-spear/index.html) adds a number of features to FpML and broadens its reach into modern frameworks beyond its historical XML/XSD roots. For more information, please refer to the [Getting The Most Out Of FpML](https://www.terahelix.io/blog/Getting-The-Most-Out-Of-FpML-Part-1/index.html) blog series.  

## Building and Running the TeraHelix FpML Application

To build and run the TeraHelix FpML Application locally, please refer to our [README-Building.md guide](README-Building.md). Pre-built, snapshot versions of FpML Spear libraries are able as GitHub Packages - https://github.com/TeraHelix/apps-FpML/packages.  

## Feature Summary

By integrating FpML with Spear, a number of additional capabilities become available. Including:

* Support for additional data formats such JSON, YAML and CSV.

* Language bindings for Python and improved language bindings for Java.

* Automatic 'flattening' of highly nested data structures to relational / rectangular data shapes appropriate for reporting tools and SQL queries.

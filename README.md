This project is a Spear integration of standard Financial products Markup Language (https://www.fpml.org/).

Combining the extensibility of Spear with comprehensive industry standard models, FpML becomes more accessible and reaches many users that would historically, for many reasons, not be able to integrate seamlessly with the XML/XSD schemas in which FpML is defined.
